# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
## AI-Powered Healthcare Analytics Platform

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The AI-Powered Healthcare Analytics Platform is an enterprise-grade solution designed to aggregate, analyze, and derive actionable insights from vast volumes of healthcare data. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), advanced analytics, and real-time processing, the platform enables healthcare organizations to improve operational efficiency, enhance patient outcomes, and reduce costs.

## 2. Business Problem Statement

Healthcare organizations struggle with fragmented data sources, manual reporting processes, and inability to extract meaningful insights quickly. Clinical decision-making often lacks real-time context, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and delayed interventions. Organizations need an intelligent system that can synthesize multi-source data and provide contextual recommendations through natural language interfaces.
